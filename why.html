            <h2>Simple & easy to use</h2>
            <p>Sek&apos;ela is developed with ease of usability 
                in mind. The system has a customizable 
                dashboard, modest configuration, interactive 
                interface design, advanced searching & 
                filtering, and advanced reporting

            <h2>Localization
            </h2>
            <p>Language is the principal method of human 
                communication. Systems with local language 
                options will improve experience and usability. 
                That&apos;s why we included Amharic and Afan 
                Oromo language options in addition to 
                English. We can easily incorporate other 
                languages as well as you requested</p>
            <h2>Unlimited branch administration
            </h2>
            <p>You don&apos;t have to deploy the system at 
                different school branches when you use 
                our SIMS. The system can manage school 
                branches and assign branch administrators</p>
